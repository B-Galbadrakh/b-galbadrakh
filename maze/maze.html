<!-- Dear professor Levi, and TA
This assignment took me 1 hour to complete. I had a little knowledge about jQuery and during doing this task I have learned a lot. I have struggled to make the logic of the game, but instead I have assigned functions that are needs to be run in certain events, using jQuery.
The game runs correctly and smoothly. User strict is being used-->
