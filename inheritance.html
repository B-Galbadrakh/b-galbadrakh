  <!-- Dear professor Levi, and TA,
My website is https://b-galbadrakh.github.io/b-galbadrakh/
You can check the this assignment from there.
In this lab I have learned the inheritance of in Javascript. Javascript is so dynamic that I think inheritance is implemented so much different from Java programming language.Â 
In order to complete this assignment I had to go to lecture slides and review once again after I have been taught in class. This helped me a lot and I learned that a lot of ways of inheritance exist in javascript.
In Second part of the assignment I stuggled a little bit with mocha test in 3rd task, but eventually I figured it out. The error was in my moche test. In second task I have implemented bubble sort on javascript, that I have implemented in first time in JS -->
