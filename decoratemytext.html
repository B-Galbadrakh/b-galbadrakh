<!-- Dear professor Levi, and TA
I have completed this assignment fully and it took me two to three hours to complete. I have linked task A and B to my web page. In the task A I have struggled a little bit with reversing string with reduce method but eventually I figured it out. 
In task B I have learned that it is best to place javascript file loading at the end of the file. However, as the template file required me to put my javascript file on top of the file I had to manage this thing. So I managed that I set up that the javascripts are in one file and it is not unobtrusive way of coding. I did the extra tasks that asked to do on http://mumstudents.org/cs472/2016-03-AS-KL/Labs/Lab06-decoratemytext.php#.
I hope I will get an extra credit by accomplishing this. I also put “use strict” mode on my javascript code, which is better when you are learning first. 
In addition on second task I also used map method to implement it on other situations and it worked. I also learned that how setInterval function works
