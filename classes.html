    Dear professor Levi, and TA
You can check my assignment on my webpage https://b-galbadrakh.github.io/b-galbadrakh/
In this assigmnet a have learned a lot, to complete this task I have spent two hours, but I have learned and researched a lot of class related things about java.
For example one struggle that I faced was looping through the _accounts array. I used for...in loop and I got 0 and 1 numbers in result. Then after doing research I understood that these are the indexes of the loop and in order to access object of array I need to use accounts[index] statement.
The next problem I have faced was my toString() methods were not working, in mocha test cases. The problem was I used super._balance, instead of this._balance. From this I understood that in class I have to use this keyword, otherwise if use super keyword it returns undefined.
