<!-- Dear progessor Levi, and TA
This assignment took me four hours to complete. In this assignment I have faced with several issues and solved them.
First, I have forgot that jQuery has click method, not onlclick. 
Second, I have struggled to show bubbles in different positions. The solution for this problem was I put them in relative div and set the appearing position by random. In this case circles appear in different places.
Also this assignment checked my knowledge on css and html, which is older topics but good to remember.
